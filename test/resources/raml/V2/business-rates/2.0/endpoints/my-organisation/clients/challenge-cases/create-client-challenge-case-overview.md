<p>This endpoint allows an Agent to perform a ‘Challenge’ on a property owned by
   the client organisation.</p>

<p>Once your request has been received we'll review your challenge and tell you if it can be accepted within 4 weeks.</p>
<p>If your challenge isn't accepted we'll tell you why.</p>
<p>There is currently no digital function to access to confirm the status of the challenge.</p>

<p>The ‘Challenge’ is for IPs/Agents to tell the VOA  that they disagree with the valuation. </p>

<p>Note that:</p>

<p>To perform a ‘Challenge’ you must have started a check on the property and the check must meet the required eligibility test</p>
