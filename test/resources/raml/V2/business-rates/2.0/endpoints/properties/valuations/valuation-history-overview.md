This endpoint returns the valuation history for the given property.  

The valuation history is a high level view of the rateable value which is available to everyone.

The VOA gives a [rateable value](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-non-domestic-property-including-plant-and-machinery-is-valued#rateable-value) or valuation to each non-domestic property and this is used by local councils to calculate a propertyâ€™s business rates.
