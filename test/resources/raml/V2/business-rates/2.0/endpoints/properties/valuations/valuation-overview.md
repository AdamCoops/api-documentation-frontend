This endpoint returns both the summary valuation and the detailed valuation when projection is defined for the given property.  

The summary valuation is a reduced version of the valuation which is available to everyone.  The full valuation is available via the detailed valuation endpoint but requires you to link the property to your organisation.

The VOA gives a [rateable value](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-non-domestic-property-including-plant-and-machinery-is-valued#rateable-value) or valuation to each non-domestic property and this is used by local councils to calculate a propertyâ€™s business rates.
